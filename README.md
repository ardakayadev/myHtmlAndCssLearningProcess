# myHtmlAndCssLearningProcess
Hello! I've been wrestling with these Html and Css stuffs for 4 months. Always trying to do some little projects as well. The whole time I'm taking notes during lessons. 

I might have done some typos forgive me!!

Hope these can help during your lessons.

Let's go beginners!
